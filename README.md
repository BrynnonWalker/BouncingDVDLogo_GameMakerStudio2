# BouncingDVDLogo_GameMakerStudio2

Setting up Gamemaker Studio 2 was relatively easy. A quick google search brought me to the downloads page (http://www.yoyogames.com/get). After setting up an account with yoyogames, I grabbed the free trial version for MAC OS IDE. The design was straightforward and visual, reminding me of Unreal's Blueprint system. I had to create scripts for each function, and an object and a sprite for the dvd logo itself. I mainly made use of forums to find out which built-in variables or functions to use for the functionality of the bouncing dvd logo. Gamemaker does have its own documentation, which I have also found to be quite nice (https://docs2.yoyogames.com/source/_build/index.html). Unforunately, Gamemaker's 'free trial' version does not allow you to build or export the application. You only run the program in Gamemaker to test it. If you want to build to devices, you have to purchase the various export licenses. For the iOS export, you would have to buy the mobile access license. It was 399$, which is a very steep price to pay before locking in Gamemaker Studio as your choice to build your game. Gamemaker's 'free trial' is more of a demo than a trial.
